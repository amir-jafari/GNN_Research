#### Week of 21st Oct:
-  Meet up with Tyler (Topics of Discussion [10/18/2024]):
  - Converting CSV to Graph Structure:
    We talked about reading data from a CSV file and converting it into a graph format.

  - Identifying the Graph Type:
    After converting the data, we need to figure out if the graph is homogeneous, heterogeneous, or bipartite.

  - Need for Graph Transformation:
    We also discussed whether we need to transform the graph depending on the type and tasks we are working on.

  - Case Studies:
    We plan to cover the following four case studies:
    - Node Classification
    - Link Prediction
    - Node Prediction
    - Sub-Graph Prediction

  #### Action Items:
  - [ ] Before starting model training, we need to fully understand and complete these tasks. After that,   we’ll move to the training phase, where we’ll look closely at each function and what happens behind the scenes.
